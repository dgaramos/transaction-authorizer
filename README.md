This project is part of a take-home test for the **Senior Software Engineer** position at **Caju Beneficios**. The objective is to implement a **transaction authorization system** that validates and stores transactions based on predefined business rules. The system integrates with a **PostgreSQL database** for persistence and exposes a **REST API** for external interaction. All available endpoints can be found in the [**Swagger** documentation](#swagger-documentation).

For further details about the challenge, please refer to the [official document](https://caju.notion.site/Desafio-T-cnico-para-fazer-em-casa-218d49808fe14a4189c3ca664857de72).

## Project Overview

The **Transaction Authorizer** is a Spring Boot application designed to:

1. Connect to a PostgreSQL database.
2. Authenticate and authorize transactions based on specific rules.
3. Provide a REST API for transaction authorization.

The application is configured to run in Docker containers with PostgreSQL as the backend database. A custom script is provided to streamline the process of building, running, and managing the application.

---

## Running the Project

You can run the project in multiple ways:

1. **Using the Provided Script** (Recommended):  
   Follow the steps in [Running the Project with the Script](#running-the-project-with-the-script) below for quick setup.

2. **[Manual Setup](docs/MANUAL_SETUP.md)**:  
   Set up and run the project manually without the script.

3. **[IntelliJ IDEA Setup](docs/INTELLIJ_SETUP.md)**:  
   Develop and run the application in IntelliJ IDEA.

---

### Running the Project with the Script

The easiest way to run the project is using the `transaction-authorizer.sh` script. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Ensure Prerequisites**:
   - Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running on your machine.
   - The script has execution permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod +x transaction-authorizer.sh
     ```

2. **Start Database**:
   Run the script to start only the database so you can run the migrations:
   ```bash
   ./transaction-authorizer.sh --start-database
   ```

3. **Run Migrations**:
   Run the script to run the migrations using flyway to generate the database schema:
   ```bash
   ./transaction-authorizer.sh --run-migrations
   ```
 4. **Start the Project**:
   Run the script to build and start the application:
   ```bash
   ./transaction-authorizer.sh --start-application
   ```

4. **Reset Environment**:
   If you need to purge cache, use the `--purge-cache` option:
   ```bash
   ./transaction-authorizer.sh --purge-cache
   ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   Once started, the application will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

If you encounter issues with the script or want more details on its features, refer to the [Script Usage Guide](docs/SCRIPT_USAGE.md).

## Swagger Documentation

This project includes Swagger for API documentation, allowing you to interact with the available REST APIs through an interactive UI.

### Accessing Swagger UI

1. [**Run the application**](#running-the-project).
2. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
   ```
   From here, you can explore and test API endpoints.

For more detailed instructions on using Swagger and exporting to Postman, see the [Swagger Usage Guide](docs/SWAGGER_USAGE.md).
